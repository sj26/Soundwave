Created to sate [Client-Side JavaScript Waveform Visualizer](https://web.archive.org/web/20111230154836/http://gun.io:80/open/4/client-side-javascript-waveform-visualizer) because it piqued my curiosity.

Allow uploading of audio clips, thumbnailing them with a waveform, then using HTML5 audio to play them back in a browser with a scrobblable/seekable waveform.

## Justification

It looks like your site is [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), but similar concepts can be applied, and you're uploading audio files. Thumbnail their waveforms, just like [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/) and other [self-respecting audio sites](http://wheelsofsteel.net/) and similar [HTML5 audio demos](http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/index.html), turning it into a scrobbler.
